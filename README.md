# Internshala-Web-Scraping-Data
Greetings,

I am Muskanpreet, and I am excited to share my project where I performed an in-depth analysis of job data scraped from Internshala. This project demonstrates my skills in web scraping, and data analysis.

This project involved scraping job postings from the Internshala website. I have utilized Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests to extract job data from Internshala. The data collected includes job titles, company names, experience required, and salary.

It highlights my proficiency in Python for data extraction.

I invite you to explore this project to see how web scraping and data analysis can provide valuable insights into job market trends.

Best Regards,

Muskanpreet
